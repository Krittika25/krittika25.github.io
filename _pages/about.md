Hi! I'm a bioinformatician currently supporting the Enteric Dieases Laboratory Branch (EDLB) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

My work focuses on benchmarking and validation next-generation sequencing workflows, particularly within the PulseNet 2.0 for national foodborne pathogen surveillance.

I specialize in:
- Microbial genomics and comparative analysis
- cgMLST allele callinh and validation studies using Illumina and ONT assemblies
- High-throughput data processing and HPC workflow optimization
- Downstream analysis including phylogenetics and interactive visualization (iTOL,GrapeTree)
- Data visualization in **Python** (matplotlib, scikit-learn) and **R** (ggplot2)
- Workflow execution and troubleshooting in Linux environments

I hold a **M.S. in Bioinformatics** from UNC Charlotte, where I contributed to plant genomics, including a publication on sorghum genome assemblies.
I also have contributed to a more recent publication on the validation of PulseNET 2.0 for *Escherichia* samples.

If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out. I love connecting with others working at the intersection of science and technology!
